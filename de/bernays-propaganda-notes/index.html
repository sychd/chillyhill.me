In place of thoughts it has impulses, habits and emotions. In making up its mind its first impulse is usually to follow the example of a trusted leader. This is one of the most firmly established principles of mass psychology.</li> <li>when the example of the leader is not at hand and the herd must think for itself, it does so by means of clich√©s, pat words or images which stand for a whole group of ideas or experiences.</li> <li>In Great Britain, during the war, the evacuation hospitals came in for a considerable amount of criticism because of the summary way in which they handled their wounded. It was assumed by the public that a hospital gives prolonged and conscientious attention to its patients. When the name was changed to evacuation posts the critical reaction vanished. No one expected more than an adequate emergency treatment from an institution so named. The clich√© hospital was indelibly associated in the public mind with a certain picture.</li> <li>It is chiefly the psychologists of the school of Freud who have pointed out that many of man‚Äôs thoughts and actions are compensatory substitutes for desires which he has been obliged to suppress.</li> <li>the successful propagandist must understand the true motives and not be content to accept the reasons which men give for what they do.</li> <li>Human desires are the steam which makes the social machine work.</li> <li>It was one of the doctrines of the reaction psychology that a certain stimulus often repeated would create a habit, or that the mere reiteration of an idea would create a conviction.</li> <li>The newer salesmanship, understanding the group structure of society and the principles of mass psychology, would first ask: ‚ÄúWho is it that influences the eating habits of the public?‚Äù The answer, obviously, is: ‚ÄúThe physicians.‚Äù The new salesman will then suggest to physicians to say publicly that it is wholesome to eat bacon.</li> <li>Suppose the old type of salesmanship, acting for a meat packer, was seeking to increase the sale of bacon. It would reiterate innumerable times in full-page advertisements: ‚ÄúEat more bacon.</li> <li>Instead of assaulting sales resistance by direct attack, he is interested in removing sales resistance.</li> <li>These key persons affect other groups, lifting the idea</li> <li>The leaders who lend their authority to any propaganda campaign will do so only if it can be made to touch their own interests.</li> <li>Continuous interpretation is achieved by trying to control every approach to the public mind in such a manner that the public receives the desired impression, often without being conscious of it. High-spotting, on the other hand, vividly seizes the attention of the public and fixes it upon some detail or aspect which is typical of the entire enterprise.</li> <li>The application of this principle of a common denominator of interest between the object that is sold and the public good will can be carried to infinite degrees.</li> <li>if you haven‚Äôt behind you a sympathetic public opinion, you are bound to fail.‚Äù</li> <li>‚ÄúIf you represent the plumbing and heating business, you are the mortal enemy of the textile industry, because warmer homes mean lighter clothes. If you represent the printers, how can you shake hands with the radio equipment man?</li> <li>The new competition is probably keenest in the food industries because there we have a very real limitation on what we can consume</li> <li>Modern business must have its finger continuously on the public pulse. It must understand the changes in the public mind and be prepared to interpret itself fairly and eloquently to changing opinion.</li> <li>Unfortunately, the methods of our contemporary politicians, in dealing with the public, are as archaic and ineffective as the advertising methods of business in 1900 would be to-day.</li> <li>Acting on the fallacy that the leader must slavishly follow, he deprives his campaign of all dramatic interest.</li> <li>The successful business man to-day apes the politician. He has adopted the glitter and the ballyhoo of the campaign. He has set up all the side shows. He has annual dinners that are a compendium of speeches, flags, bombast, stateliness, pseudo-democracy slightly tinged with paternalism.</li> <li>Unrelated emotions become maudlin and sentimental too easily, are often costly, and too often waste effort because the idea is not part of the conscious and coherent whole.</li> <li>Even Henry Ford, the most picturesque personality in business in America to-day, has become known through his product, and not his product through him.</li> <li>The public is made up of interlocking groups ‚Äîeconomic, social, religious, educational, cultural, racial, collegiate, local, sports, and hundreds of others. When President Coolidge invited actors for breakfast, he did so because he realized not only that actors were a group, but that audiences, the large group of people who like amusements, who like people who amuse them, and who like people who can be amused, ought to be aligned with him.</li> <li>The important thing for the statesman of our age is not so much to know how to please the public, but to know how to sway the public.</li> <li>Czecho-Slovakia officially became a free state on Monday, October 28, 1918, instead of Sunday, October 27, 1918, because Professor Masaryk realized that the people of the world would receive more information and would be more receptive to the announcement of the republic‚Äôs freedom on a Monday morning than on a Sunday, because the press would have more space to devote to it on Monday morning.</li> <li>He may send out an anonymous interview through the press. He then waits for reverberations to come from the public‚Äîa public which expresses itself in mass meetings, or resolutions, or telegrams, or even such obvious manifestations as editorials in the partisan or nonpartisan press. On the basis of these repercussions he then publicly adopts his original tentative policy, or rejects it, or modifies it to conform to the sum of public opinion which has reached him. This method is modeled on the peace feelers which were used during the war to sound out the disposition of the enemy</li> <li>If a politician is a real leader he will be able, by the skillful use of propaganda, to lead the people, instead of following the people by means of the clumsy instrument of trial and error. The propagandist‚Äôs approach is the exact opposite of that of the politician just described. The whole basis of successful propaganda is to have an objective and then to endeavor to arrive at it through an exact knowledge of the public and modifying circumstances to manipulate and sway that public.</li> <li>‚ÄúWhen the interval between the intellectual classes and the practical classes is too great,‚Äù says the historian Buckle, ‚Äúthe former will possess no influence, the latter will reap no benefits.‚Äù</li> <li>The statesman of the future will thus be enabled to focus the public mind on crucial points of policy, and regiment a vast, heterogeneous mass of voters to clear understanding and intelligent action.</li></ul><!----></div></div></article><!----><!----></main> <footer class="relative h-16 bg-[url('/images/background-banner.svg')] bg-cover bg-center"><div class="absolute h-6 w-full bg-gradient-to-t from-transparent to-gray-50 dark:to-gray-800"></div> <section class="container"><div class="flex pt-8 text-xs text-cyan-900 dark:text-secondary">Denys Sych ¬© 2025</div></section></footer></div><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
